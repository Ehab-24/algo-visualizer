# Algorithm Visualizer

Algo Visualizer is a web application built with the flutter framework and hosted on firebase.

## Description

This web application is designed specifically for those who are new to data structures and algorithms in computer science, as it is a tool to visualize some of the most famous pathfinding and sorting algorithms out there.

## Pathfinding

You can visualize the following five algorithms on a custom maze

* A-star search
* Dijkstra's algorithm
* Best first search
* Breadth first search
* Depth first search

## Sorting

You can visualize the following six sorting algorithms with a custom size array

* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
* Quick sort
* Heap sort
* Bubble sort
* Cocktail sort
